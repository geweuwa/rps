Rock paper scissors

This is my first real python project, the goal is to creat an ai, a rock paper scissors bot, to be able to play rock paper scissors.
at to be able to succsesfully predict which choice any user will pick, and thus, winning most rounds.
to play, just run the script, and pick r, p, or s.
